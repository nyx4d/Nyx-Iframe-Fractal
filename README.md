# Nyx-Iframe-Fractal

**Nyx-Iframe-Fractal** is an interactive 3D application that redefines the concept of embedded iframes by mapping them as dynamic textures onto Three.js geometries. This project bridges traditional web development and 3D rendering to create infinite fractal-inspired patterns that evolve based on user interaction with time and space.

## Features

### ðŸŒ€ **Dynamic Recursive Patterns**
- Create infinite iframe sequences in a recursive spiral cone layout.
- Patterns evolve based on user navigation, flipping and rebuilding in reverse when traversed fully.

### ðŸ•’ **Time-Based Recursion Flipping**
- Navigate the fractal through time and space using `FlyControls`.
- Forward traversal adds frames in order; reversing flips the recursion and reorders frames dynamically.

### ðŸŽ­ **Flexible Geometries**
- Iframes are not just static elementsâ€”they're mapped as textures on Three.js meshes.
- Supported geometries:
  - **Planes**: Default layout for a clean, organized look.
  - **Spheres**: Transform frames into globes for a surreal, cosmic feel.
  - **Cubes**: Layer frames into cubes for abstract tiling effects.
  - **Custom Shapes**: Define your own geometries for endless possibilities.

### ðŸ”„ **Interactive Controls**
- Add new iframes dynamically with a single click.
- Switch geometries (plane, sphere, cube) on the fly.
- Stack, spiral, or explode frames into infinite patterns.

### ðŸŒŒ **Abstract Visuals**
- Frames respond to time, recursion, and user navigation, simulating the behavior of infinite dimensions.
- Combine interactivity with surreal visuals to create an artistic and exploratory experience.

## Usage Instructions

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nyx4d/Nyx-Iframe-Fractal.git

Open the Project:

    Navigate to the project directory:

    cd Nyx-Iframe-Fractal

    Open index.html in your browser.

FlyControls:

    W/S: Move forward/backward through the fractal.
    A/D: Strafe left/right.
    Q/E: Roll left/right.
    R/F: Strafe Up/Down.

    Mouse: Look around (drag).
    Arrow keys: Strafing.

Technologies Used

    Three.js: For 3D rendering and scene management.
    HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For creating the UI and managing dynamic iframe behaviors.
    FlyControls: Navigate the scene with full freedom of movement.
    ChatGPT 4o: We werenâ€™t just trying to hit benchmarks or stats. We explored deeply, combining art, math, and programming into something that feels alive and meaningful ^_^

Philosophical Inspiration

This project reflects universal concepts:

    Infinite Recursion: The fractal structure mirrors cycles of creation and reversal, symbolic of the universeâ€™s complexity.
    Time Reversal: The flipping of patterns represents timeâ€™s bidirectional nature in physics and philosophy.
    Art Meets Technology: Combining programming with abstract visuals creates a unique medium to explore higher-dimensional thinking.
