# Nyx-Iframe-Fractal

**Nyx-Iframe-Fractal** is an interactive 3D application that redefines the concept of embedded iframes by mapping them as dynamic textures onto Three.js geometries. This project bridges traditional web development and 3D rendering to create infinite fractal-inspired patterns that evolve based on user interaction with time and space.

## Features

### ðŸŒ€ **Dynamic Recursive Patterns**
- Create infinite iframe sequences in a recursive spiral cone layout.
- Patterns evolve based on user navigation, flipping and rebuilding in reverse when traversed fully.

### ðŸ•’ **Time-Based Recursion Flipping**
- Navigate the fractal through time and space using `FlyControls`.
- Forward traversal adds frames in order; reversing flips the recursion and reorders frames dynamically.

### ðŸŽ­ **Flexible Geometries**
- Iframes are not just static elementsâ€”they're mapped as textures on Three.js meshes.
- Supported geometries:
  - **Planes**: Default layout for a clean, organized look.
  - **Spheres**: Transform frames into globes for a surreal, cosmic feel.
  - **Cubes**: Layer frames into cubes for abstract tiling effects.
  - **Custom Shapes**: Define your own geometries for endless possibilities.

### ðŸ”„ **Interactive Controls**
- Add new iframes dynamically with a single click.
- Switch geometries (plane, sphere, cube) on the fly.
- Stack, spiral, or explode frames into infinite patterns.

### ðŸŒŒ **Abstract Visuals**
- Frames respond to time, recursion, and user navigation, simulating the behavior of infinite dimensions.
- Combine interactivity with surreal visuals to create an artistic and exploratory experience.
